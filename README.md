# Crystalcraft-Glowing
This texture pack adds emissive textures to the textures of the Crystalcraft Unlimited mod. This means that most blocks, like ores, glow.

How to use:

- Install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity/versions) (and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) )(recommended) or [optifine]([https://optifine.net/downloads](https://optifine.net/downloads)).
- Install the [Crystalcraft Unlimited mod]([https://modrinth.com/mod/crystalcraft-unlimited/changelog](https://modrinth.com/mod/crystalcraft-unlimited/changelog))
- Install [this](https://modrinth.com/project/crystalcraft-glowing/versions) texture pack.

At the moment all blocks, entities and some items are supported. Armor is also planned, although it will only work with shaders that support PBR or Optifine.
